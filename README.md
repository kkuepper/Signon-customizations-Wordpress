# Auth0 Plugin - Wordpress

This repo will contain all the custom code that is needed for the Wordpress websites.

## Snippets

The code written in those files can be used different ways:
- Paste it in the `functions.php` file of the current theme. **Warning:** if you use a downloaded theme, make sure that you create a child theme, and that you edit the child theme!
- Download the plugin [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)  and create a snippet for each file.
